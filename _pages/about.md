Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Farzad.

A software and robotics engineer with over a decade of experience building intelligent systems at the intersection of research and production. I specialize in AI, computer vision, autonomous systems, and cloud platformsâ€”developing robust software by day and prototyping autonomous robots and self-driving vehicles by night.

My background includes championship in RoboCup humanoid soccer league, developing privacy-preserving RAG systems, and delivering platforms used by hundreds of thousands of users with significant revenue impact. I value teamwork, communication, and resilience, and I love turning ambitious ideas into impactful products.

Letâ€™s connect and build something remarkable together.
