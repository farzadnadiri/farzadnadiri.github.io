Hi there 👋 I am Farzad,

I am an applied scientist with over a decade of experience designing, training, and deploying intelligent systems. My work sits at the intersection of research and production, where I formulate problems, build models and algorithms, and integrate them into reliable services that run at scale. I specialize in AI, NLP, computer vision, autonomous systems, and cloud platforms.

My background includes RoboCup humanoid soccer world and national championships, sensor fusion and localization for humanoid robots and autonomous vehicles, privacy preserving retrieval augmented generation systems for legal workloads, and platforms that serve hundreds of thousands of users and drive multi million dollar annual revenue. I enjoy working end to end, from data and modeling to deployment and monitoring, and I care about clear communication, collaboration, and measurable outcomes.

Let us connect and build something impactful together.
